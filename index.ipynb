    "2. [Text Scraping](#q2) Write a secondary function that scrapes the lyrics for each song page.\n",
    "3. [Combining Parts](#q3) Create a script using your two functions above to scrape all of the song lyrics for a given artist.\n",
    "4. [Visualizing](#q4) Generate two bar graphs to compare lyrical changes for the artist of your chose. For example, the two bar charts could compare the lyrics for two different songs or two different albums.\n",

    "Think about how you structured the data from your web scraper. Did you scrape the entire song lyrics verbatim? Did you simply store the words and their frequency counts, or did you do something else entirely? List out a few different options for how you could have stored this data. What are advantages and disadvantages of each? Be specific and think about what sort of analyses each representation would lend itself to."
